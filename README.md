# Quote Image Generator
> A simple quote image generator

## Introduction
QuotePost is a pure JS web application that allows users to generate modern, card-style quote images. <br>
I was largely inspired by the great work of [palinkiewicz](https://github.com/palinkiewicz) with [LyricPost](https://github.com/palinkiewicz/lyricpost), shout out to him!

## Features
- **Live Editing** - Click directly on the quote, title, or author to edit in real-time
- **Multiple Layouts** - Choose from 6 beautifully designed layout options:
  - Classic
  - Header First
  - Full Top
  - Full Bottom
  - Centered
  - Minimalist
- **Color Customization** - Pick from preset colors or use a custom color picker
- **Image Upload** - Add your own images to personalize quotes
- **Download Quote Image** - Download your creation as a PNG image
